# binary_pin_guess
This program is a guessing game that the user has to guess a 4 number(binary) code<br/>
This is a simple guessing game where the user can either enter a 0 or 1 for each pin number<br/>
If they guess the right combination a message congratulates them and the program exits<br/>
example of 1 possible guess: 0 1 0 0<br/>
Dont judge me this is one of my first programs when i didn't know how to use namespace std and had to write out std:: everytime<br/>
rip<br/>
